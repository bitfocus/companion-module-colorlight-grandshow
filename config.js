						<strong>Please read and understand the following before using this module</strong>
						<br>
						The companion project started out as an attempt to make the everyday life of a technician easier. We've held back generic TCP/UDP modules for a long time
						to ensure that we have ready made actions, presets and feedbacks for as many products as possible.
						<ul>
							<li>You shoudn't need to go around remembering raw TCP commands</li>
							<li>If you have a product we don't support, please file a module request for it</li>
							<li>Do you think your product/device is too insignificant to make a module for, it's not.</li>
							<li>Properitary/inhouse products can also have their own modules.</li>
							<li>Please use Generic TCP/UDP as a last resort</li>
							<li>With generic modules you won't get nice things like presets and feedback</li>
						</ul>
